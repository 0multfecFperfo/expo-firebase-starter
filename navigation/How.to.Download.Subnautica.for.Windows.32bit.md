## Why You Should Upgrade to a 64-bit Operating System
 
While you can download Subnautica for Windows 32-bit using the methods above, you might not be able to enjoy the full potential of the game. This is because Subnautica is designed for 64-bit operating systems, which can handle more memory and processing power than 32-bit operating systems.
 
A 32-bit operating system can only use up to 4 GB of RAM, while a 64-bit operating system can use more than that. This means that Subnautica will run faster and smoother on a 64-bit operating system, as it can access more resources and avoid crashes or lags. Moreover, some features of Subnautica may not work properly on a 32-bit operating system, such as terraforming, modding, or multiplayer.
 
If you want to upgrade to a 64-bit operating system, you can use your existing license key to install Windows 64-bit on your computer. You can also buy a new license key from Microsoft or other
