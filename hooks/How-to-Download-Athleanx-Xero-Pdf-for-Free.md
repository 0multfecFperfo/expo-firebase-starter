What is Athleanx Xero?
 
Athleanx Xero is a bodyweight training program that challenges you to use your own body as your only resistance. Unlike other bodyweight programs that rely on high reps and low intensity, Athleanx Xero uses advanced techniques and exercises that stimulate muscle growth and fat loss at the same time.
 
The program is divided into three phases, each lasting four weeks. The first phase is called "X-tinction", where you perform workouts that push you to your limit and beyond. The second phase is called "X-celeration", where you perform workouts that increase your speed, power, and explosiveness. The third phase is called "X-treme", where you perform workouts that combine strength, endurance, and athleticism.
 
Each workout consists of six exercises that target different muscle groups and functions. You will perform each exercise for a certain number of reps or time, depending on the workout. You will also have to follow the "Xero Rest Protocol", which determines how much rest you get between sets and exercises. The program also includes weekly challenges that test your performance and progress.
 
Athleanx Xero also comes with a nutrition plan that helps you optimize your results. The plan is based on the concept of "X-Factor Meal Plan", which allows you to eat what you want, when you want, as long as you follow some simple rules. The plan also provides you with sample meals, recipes, and supplements recommendations.
